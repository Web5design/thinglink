What is this?
-------------

Thinglink.com is a web service that allows regions in images to be "tagged" in
a manner similar to that you may be used to from Flickr's "Add Notes" feature.

The Thinglink API supports to embedding of an "in-place tagging tool on third-
party websites that allows images to be tagged without the need to visit the
Thinglink.com site.

This Drupal module enables this process for a Drupal site: once installed and
configured, the module automatically adds the necessary Thinglink Javascript
to every image on your Drupal site, allowing you to add tags, share the image,
and obtain an image embed code directly on your site.

How to Install
--------------

* Install this module for your Drupal site.
* Sign up for a Thinglink account at http://www.thinglink.com/
* Visit http://www.thinglink.com/action/massembed to get your "Thinglink ID".
* On admin/settings/thinglink on your site, enter your "Thinglink ID".

You should now find all images on your site automatically have the Thinglink
tagging tool enabled: just hover over an image and you should see the 
Thinglink toolbar in the top-left.
